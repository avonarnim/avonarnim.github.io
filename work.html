          I grew up in Knoxville, Tennessee knowing almost nothing about the
          tech industry. I studied math and science voraciously until I hit
          college, at which point I pivoted into the field I love today. Read

            Wanting to get more experience developing professional apps, I

            When I joined the project, it was at ground floor. As a part of the
            team, I added search-engine functionality, created the ability for
            merchants to highlight specific items, and created pages for
            collections, items, articles, and profiles. I also worked on
            calculating user-facing metrics for collections and profiles, such
            as floor price, total volume, and unique items.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also created the profile page infrastructure, which integrates
            with Alchemy to fetch user data and links to various social media
            platforms for quick sharing.

          <p>
            I interned on the SQL Engineering systems team at Microsoft from
            May-August 2022. Hundreds of engineers contribute to SQL on a daily
            basis, each frequently pushing a new block of code. After a while,
            individual commits cause code to degrade. The team decides to start
            testing aggressively to validate all this potentially faulty new
            code. But with over 2 million tests, you can't actually run all
            tests on each new block of code...
          </p>
          <p>
            You then decide to run different test batches on any new commit and
            eventually circle back to the same test batches so that -- over time
            -- you'll use the same tests again. If it was initially passing but
            is now failing, you now know that somewhere between those two runs
            -- somewhere in that range of, say, 100 commits -- one commit broke
            the code. You then triangulate that break and kick it out.
          </p>
          <p>
            My job deals with extending this process to more sporadic test
            results.

          </p>
          <p class="job-subtitle">Dude, Where's My Bike</p>
          <p>
            Have you ever had your bike stolen? I haven't, but I'm pretty sure
            it sucks! I worked on this project, which had a main goal of
            creating a bike-locating app ideal for bike-recovery as well as
            recommending safe locations ideal for parking bikes.
          </p>
          <p>
            My role on the team was setting up the GPS-enabled data source,
            which came in the shape of a Boron Particle micro-controller.
          </p>
          <div class="work-imgs-right">
            <img
              class="work-img-right"
              src="imgs/bike-diagram.png"
              alt="bike diagram"
              text-align="right"
            />
          </div>
          <p class="job-subtitle">Compost-o-Matic</p>
          <p>
            Composting is the process of turning food scraps and other organic
            material into nutrient-rich soil that can be used to fertilize
            future crops. In other words, it's a great way to improve nutrient
            cycling in communities that don't traditionally grow crops on an
            industrial level (think university gardens!).
          </p>
          <p>
            The only issue with this is that creating a healthy compost can be
            hard! It requires the proper moisture content and sufficient but not
            overly-sufficient heat. If these metrics go out-of-whack, the
            compost can start producing methane and won't be environmentally
            positive.
          </p>
          <p>
            Compost-o-Matic aimed to improve the process of creating a healthy
            compost pile by creating a smart-monitoring device. Pulling
            experience from my previous project, Dude Where's My Bike, I set up
            the initial datalink between the sensor-microcontroller to a web-app
            dashboard reporting the sensor readings.

          <p class="job-subtitle">Reverse Choreography</p>
          <p>
            Consider the situation where a choreographer wants to use a new move
            in a piece. They may either have to pace the move to match the music
            that's already been chosen or they may have to search through
            endless songs for some clip that matches the move.
          </p>
          <p>
            This akin to giving a painter a warped canvas and saying to either
            try to make it work or look for a better one in a pile of seemingly
            all warped canvases.
          </p>
          <p>
            To remedy this, a team and I worked to build a video
            capture-to-music recommendation pipeline that interprets body
            movement as the basis for suggesting potentially appropriate songs
            to dance to.
          </p>
          <p>
            How good are the recommendations? Hmu and judge for yourself! (in
            all honesty, you'll probably be like "meh, pretty cool, but not
            blown away")

            As a strategy developer/SWE at this student-run prop-trading
            startup, I was given the task of implementing a value-based
            investing strategy as an auto-trader.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through this experience, I was able to not only improve as a
            developer, working with a new platform on time-series data, but also
            able to dive deep into a business-focused topic that grounded all
            decisions being made:
          </p>
          <p>
            The main lesson I learned was that theory and results are both
            important. The graphs shown here are pulled from an auto-trader that
            (to my knowledge) is still being used to make trades on the market.

          <p>
            My first work experience in tech was at a healthcare tech startup
            called Prediction Health. Being at a startup, the number and breadth
            of tasks to handle was beyond what most 3-month internship or
            semester-long club projects will offer you. For example, I spent the
            first two weeks just making data intake systems responsive to more
            third-party data output formats... boring stuff but a good way to
            freshen up to basic software engineering!
          </p>
          <p>
            My next couple weeks were potentially even less glamorous -- fixing
            every single test (meaning over 100 tests spanning everything from
            NLP processing pipelines to in-app notifications to authentication
            to user-input) that was failing on the backend... again, gritty work
            but undoubtedly a great way to learn a lot very fast
          </p>
          <p>
            I finished off the internship working on evaluating speech-to-text
            providers' accuracy and creating ML models that either attempted to
            detect ambient noise or split up audio by speaker. This was my first
            foray into what is largely considered cutting-edge
