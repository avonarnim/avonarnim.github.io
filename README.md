# avonarnim.github.io

This is my personal website - accessible via any browser at avonarnim.github.io - displaying some of my (or others') most recent puns as well as some sayings or quotes that resonate with me on some level.
It's intentionally left pretty empty, but if you have any questions, feel free to drop me a line :)
