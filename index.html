            <p>Hey! I'm <b>Adam von Arnim</b>. Welcome to my website!</p>
            <p>
              I'm a software engineer studying <b>CS & Applied Math</b> at USC.
            </p>
            <p>
              Previously, I've worked at startups like Prediction Health doing
              <b>audio ML and interoperability</b> and Blackbox Trading doing
              <b>quantitative trading</b>. I've also worked on backend data
              pipelines at Amazon and am currently working at
              <b>Microsoft</b> on the SQL Engineering Systems team.
            </p>
            <p>
              In school, I've helped
              <b>co-found Quant SC</b> and been a part of several
              <b>IoT projects at Makers</b>, including a bike-locating project,
              a smart composting IoT device, and a dance-based
              song-recommendation model. I also used to do
              <b>ecological data science research</b> at the Nuzhdin Lab.
            </p>
            <p>
              Outside of work, you can find me hiking in the Smokies, bouldering
              at Vital, reading plaques at art museums, or skimming a book on my
              roof.
